        <h3>Guided meditation</h3>
        <p>
            If you feel ready to give meditation a try you will find both a step by step guide
            to guide you through your meditation and a video intended to do the same thing,
            if you'd rather follow an audio-visual guide. 
            <br> <br>
            Before you start, find a quiet undisturbed place, idealy a room in your home or any 
            other place where you can be left alone.
        </p>
        <!--List, how to meditate-->
        <ol id="practice-list">
            <li>
                <em>Position yourself comfortably</em> either by sitting down cross-legged on the floor on top of
                a cuchion, sit upright in a comfortable chair or lie down
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <em>Relax</em>, set a timer somwhere in between 5-15 minutes, close your eyes and start 
                by taking a coupple deep, but natural, breaths. Inhale through your nose, and let the air
                 fill your stomach, then exhale through either your mouth or nose, choose the one you 
                 are most comfortable with.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <em>Focus on your breaths</em> and become aware of the feeling and sound of your breaths 
                as you inhale and exhale, try not to think about anything else but the rytmic pattern 
                of your natural brething.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <em>Keep your mind from wandering.</em> As you start meditating you will realize it is 
                impossible to actually stop your mind from wandering, so dont blame yourself for not being 
                able to stop it from happening. Instead, pay attention to the thoughts appearing in your mind
                without judging it. Simply pay attention to them, then go back to focusing on your breathing.
                Notice the sounds in your surrondings, the feelings in your body. Stay in the presentand dont 
                give the past or future any attention.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <em>Your alarm is ringing!</em> Have you noticed the healing effects 
                of your mindfulness meditation? Dont worry, just like exercising, meditation takes practice.
                You probably felt calm and very relaxed during your session, but to incorperate mindfulness in 
                your everyday life you will need to practice it regularly. 
                Try doing it every day or a coupple of times a week.
                Good luck!
