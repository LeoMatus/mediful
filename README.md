# MEDIFUL

MEDIFUL is a site with the intention to introduce people to mindfulness meditation. It is supposed to give people who have not yet tried meditating an overlook of what it is 
and a guide to their first session. It guides you either via a step by step guide or a video with the same intention. The site explains the benefits of meditation and why 
everyone should try it.
