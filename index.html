                <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
                <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation focused on the wellbeing of your mind, 
                by focusing your attention to the exact sensations and feelings that you are experiencing in the moment
                without judgement. Many have the missconception of minfulness that you are supposed to have a blank mind, 
                without any thoughts or emotions. this is however imposible. Your mind is constantly running and as you meditate
                you will quickly realize that your thoughts are running in a constant stream, and they are very hard to controll.
                With that in mind, you can instead focus on what is causing those thoughts, and get a better understanding of
                how your mind works.

                <h3>Why is mindfulness usefull?</h3>
                <p>
                    The daily life of a modern human is often a stressful one, packed with responsibilities
                    and distractions. It seldom gives the mind time to rest. It is easy to get stuck thinking about past events
                    that you cant get over or thinking about the future in a way that makes you feel anxious. 
                    This can for many lead to anxiety and symptoms of depression. 
                    By meditating you get a better understanding of your mind and the thoughts that appear inside it,
                    which in turn helps you controll your emotions, both negative and positive, as they appear. The techniques you learn
                    when meditating can be used in any part of you everyday life, no matter if you are alone in your room, on an
                    buisness meeting or while you are spending time with your loved ones. This can give you a sense of calm
                    and help support your emotional well-being. Meditation can even help manage some medical symptoms.

                    Focusing on the benifits you will get from meditation is not recomended as it can distract you 
                    from the actual practice, there are however many benifits to be gained from meditating.
                    Many studies and clinical trials have been made on meditation and the benifits it provides.           
                    Meditiating regularly as mentioned before reduces your stress and helps give insight on your own mind.
                    Understanding your own mind will automatically help you pay attention to others well-being.
